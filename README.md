# Welcome
This repository contains the animation source code for my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE-9gcnLnBjS0qqLxFXkIOw). The animations are produced [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), an open source Python library for creating math animations.

As of now, I only have one video. I have some ideas I want to work on, but just haven't found the time (school is hard). If you are interesting in contributing, or have any interesting ideas you want to share, feel free to reach out.
